Smart Malware with Evasion and Cloud Exfiltration Capabilities

Overview
This project involves developing a modular and adaptive malware prototype designed for academic or red-team research purposes. The malware focuses on advanced evasion techniques, cloud-based data exfiltration, and dynamic mutation to avoid detection by antivirus and endpoint monitoring tools. It combines low-level data collection and sandbox evasion (in C or Rust) with high-level encryption and exfiltration logic (in Python).

Objective
Design a malware sample that:
Changes its structure on each build to avoid signature-based detection
Detects sandboxed or virtualized environments to prevent analysis
Stealthily exfiltrates sensitive files to the cloud
Employs obfuscation and evasion techniques to bypass logging and antivirus tools

Task Breakdown
1. System Data Collection (C or Rust)
Gather system metadata: hostname, running processes, user accounts, network interfaces
Check for virtual machines, sandbox artifacts, and debuggers
Log system activity while minimizing traceability

2. Cloud Exfiltration & Communication (Python)
Encrypt selected files using AES or hybrid encryption
Upload data to AWS S3 using secure API access
Use DNS record encoding to hide command-and-control messages or file hashes

3. Antivirus and Logging Evasion
Randomize:
Variable and function names
File paths and filenames
Control flow and structure using polymorphic techniques
Implement multiple build variants with random traits per execution
Avoid triggering alerts from Sysmon, OSSEC, and similar endpoint detection systems

Evasion Techniques Used
String obfuscation and encryption
Code mutation per build (polymorphism)
Use of legitimate services (e.g., AWS S3, DNS) to avoid suspicion
Conditional execution based on sandbox detection
Disabling or bypassing logging and monitoring agents

Tools and Technologies
Languages: Rust, C, Python
Cloud: AWS S3
Encryption: AES, Fernet, or RSA (Python cryptography libraries)
Monitoring Evasion: Sysmon, OSSEC
Obfuscation: Custom code, base64, XOR, polymorphic code generation
