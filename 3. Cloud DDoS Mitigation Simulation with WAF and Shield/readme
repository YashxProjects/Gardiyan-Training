Cloud DDoS Mitigation Simulation with WAF and Shield

Overview
This project demonstrates how to simulate and mitigate a volumetric Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack targeting a cloud-hosted web application on AWS. By deploying a basic web service behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB), the system applies AWS WAF and AWS Shield (Advanced if available) to enforce real-time protection, monitor attack patterns, and respond automatically to threats.

Task Breakdown
1. Web Application Deployment
Launch a simple web application on an EC2 instance behind an ALB to serve as the DDoS target.

2. DDoS Simulation
Generate a volumetric or resource-exhaustion attack using tools like slowloris or hping3 to test system resilience and visibility.

3. WAF Configuration
Apply AWS WAF protections, including:
Rate-based limiting
IP address blocking
Bot control and challenge mechanisms

4. Monitoring and Visualization
Use Amazon CloudWatch to:
Track incoming request volume and patterns
Set up custom dashboards and alarms to detect anomalies

5. Automated IP Banning
Deploy an AWS Lambda function to detect abnormal behavior (e.g., excessive requests from an IP) and automatically update WAF rules or security groups.

6. Policy Tuning and Analysis
Analyze attack logs and mitigation results to:
Assess the effectiveness of configured rules
Optimize WAF policies for better accuracy and reduced false positives

Tools and Technologies
Attack Simulation: slowloris, hping3
Protection: AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced (if available), Application Load Balancer
Automation: AWS Lambda
Monitoring: Amazon CloudWatch, CloudWatch Dashboards
