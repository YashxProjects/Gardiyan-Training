## Gardiyan Training – Advanced Cybersecurity Task Suite
This repository contains a portfolio of advanced cybersecurity analyst tasks completed as part of the Gardiyan Training Program. Each task is designed to simulate real-world attack-defense scenarios across enterprise, cloud, and hybrid infrastructures with a strong emphasis on automation, cryptography, anomaly detection, and red/blue teaming.

#  Highlights
1. AI-Powered Detection: Deployed unsupervised machine learning models to flag real-time anomalies from Zeek logs and NetFlow data.

2. SDN-Driven Security: Built a programmable OpenFlow controller that dynamically adapts traffic rules based on behavior.

3. Cloud-Native DDoS Defense: Simulated botnet attacks and mitigated using WAF rules, rate limiting, and AWS Shield protections.

4. Red Team Engineering: Created evasive malware variants with anti-VM, anti-debug, and polymorphic loaders for training blue teams.

5. Quantum-Resistant Encryption: Integrated Kyber-based post-quantum key exchange in VPN tunnels for forward secrecy.

6. Stealth Malware & Exfiltration: Designed and obfuscated cross-platform malware with DNS-based data hiding and AWS delivery.

7. Automated DevSecOps: Embedded Bandit, Trivy, Semgrep into CI/CD pipelines for proactive container and code scanning.

8. Cloud Compliance Monitoring: Built dashboards to map real-time security controls to GRC standards (ISO 27001, NIST 800-53).

9. Threat Simulation Grid: Deployed multi-cloud honeypots (Cowrie, Dionaea) and correlated attacks across layers for detection tuning.

# Hands-On Experience and Certification Through Gardiyan
I had the privilege of joining Gardiyan’s observation phase, where I gained hands-on experience in foundational cybersecurity principles, threat detection, and defensive operations. Under the guidance of highly skilled mentors, I was introduced to industry-standard frameworks and tools, which helped solidify my understanding of core security concepts. Over the course of my training, I became familiar with 52 professional cybersecurity tools and technologies spanning traffic analysis, threat detection, offensive testing, cryptography, cloud platforms, and more. I also completed an Active Directory Security & Administration project, applying 60 structured security and administration tasks in a simulated enterprise environment. Additionally, I enrolled in the CySA+ certification course offered by Gardiyan, further deepening my theoretical and practical knowledge in areas such as risk management, network security, and cryptography. I hold deep respect for the structured and professional environment provided by Gardiyan, and I'm currently in Gardiyan’s training program (Cybersecurity Analyst), actively applying and expanding upon the concepts learned. This experience has been instrumental in shaping my cybersecurity journey with both discipline and clarity.

# Mentorship & Team Collaboration
During my time with Gardiyan, I had the privilege of working under the guidance of highly skilled and experienced senior cybersecurity professionals, whose insights and feedback played a crucial role in shaping my technical and analytical approach. Their mentorship created a strong foundation for continuous learning and real-world application of cybersecurity principles. I was also fortunate to work under the SOC Manager, whose leadership provided invaluable exposure to high-level security operations and strategic incident handling. I also had the opportunity to collaborate closely with the SOC Level 1 (L1) team, which was one of the most rewarding and educational aspects of my journey. The team’s structured processes, rapid response strategies, and professionalism provided a live operational context that textbooks alone cannot offer. One of the standout qualities of Gardiyan's environment was its exceptional communication culture—open, respectful, and knowledge-driven. The clarity in task delegation, timely feedback loops, and team synergy made every engagement smooth, effective, and deeply enriching. I’m truly grateful to have been part of such a well-organized and expert-led ecosystem.

# Gratitude & Appreciation
I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the entire Gardiyan team for providing such a remarkable opportunity to grow and contribute in a real-world cybersecurity environment. From technical guidance to hands-on learning, and from structured workflows to open communication, every aspect of my experience has been truly invaluable. I’m especially thankful for the mentorship, trust, and support I received throughout my observation period. Working alongside such a talented and dedicated team has been both inspiring and educational. This experience has not only sharpened my skills but also deepened my understanding of professional cybersecurity operations.
Thank you, Gardiyan, for the trust, the learning, and the opportunity.
