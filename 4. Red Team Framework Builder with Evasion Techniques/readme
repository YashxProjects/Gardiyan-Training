Red Team Framework Builder with Evasion Techniques

Overview
This project focuses on building a modular red team framework designed to support post-exploitation operations, payload delivery, and data exfiltration â€” while incorporating advanced evasion techniques. The framework includes encrypted reverse shells, customizable obfuscators, and exfiltration modules to simulate realistic adversarial behavior in a controlled environment.

Task Breakdown
1. Modular Framework Design
Develop a flexible and extensible architecture to integrate various offensive security components, including:
Encrypted command-and-control (C2) channels
Evasion and obfuscation layers
Data exfiltration utilities

2. Encrypted Reverse Shells
Implement secure reverse shells using encryption techniques to maintain covert communication between compromised hosts and the operator.

3. Payload Obfuscation and Evasion
Integrate:
String and binary obfuscators
Anti-analysis techniques (sandbox, debugger, and VM detection)
Basic antivirus evasion mechanisms (polymorphic behavior, packing)

4. Exfiltration Modules
Design pluggable modules for stealthy data extraction over:
HTTP/S
DNS tunneling
Cloud storage APIs

5. Payload Stagers
Develop lightweight stagers in both:
C and Python 

Tools and Technologies
Languages: C, Python
Encryption: OpenSSL, custom AES implementations
Obfuscation: Base64, XOR, polymorphism
Exfiltration: HTTP, DNS, 
Delivery: Manual staging, dynamic generation
