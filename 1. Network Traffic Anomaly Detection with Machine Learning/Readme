Network Traffic Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning

Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system for detecting and responding to suspicious network activity. By analyzing network traffic in real time and identifying anomalies, the system can automatically take action to mitigate threats by blocking malicious IPs using Fail2Ban.

Task Breakdown
1. Data Capture
Tshark (Wireshark CLI) to monitor and log network traffic.

2. Feature Extraction
Parse the captured data to extract relevant features such as:
Packet size statistics
Protocol frequency
IP reputation scores

3. Machine Learning Model
Use scikit-learn to train and apply an anomaly detection model. Supported models include:
Random Forest (for classification-based detection)
Isolation Forest (for unsupervised anomaly detection)

4. Automated Blocking
Integrate the detection pipeline with Fail2Ban to automatically block IP addresses identified as malicious.

Tools and Technologies
Network Analysis: Zeek, Tshark
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Automation and Blocking: Fail2Ban
