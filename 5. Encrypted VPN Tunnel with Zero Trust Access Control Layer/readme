Encrypted VPN Tunnel with Zero Trust Access Control Layer

Overview
This project implements an encrypted VPN tunnel enhanced with a zero trust access control mechanism. By integrating a Python-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) gateway using Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP), the system enforces identity verification before allowing VPN access. All access attempts are logged and can be centrally monitored through a unified dashboard.

Task Breakdown
1. VPN Tunnel Deployment
Set up a secure OpenVPN tunnel between two virtual machines to enable encrypted network communication.

2. MFA Gateway Integration
Develop and deploy a Python-based MFA gateway that:
Authenticates users using TOTP (e.g., Google Authenticator)
Acts as a gatekeeper before VPN credentials are released or connections are accepted

3. Zero Trust Enforcement
Ensure access is granted only after successful MFA verification, aligning with Zero Trust principles (i.e., never trust, always verify).

4. Logging and Monitoring
Log all authentication and access attempts, including:
Timestamps
Source IPs

Success/failure status
Integrate logs with a central monitoring dashboard for visibility and auditing.

Tools and Technologies
VPN: OpenVPN
Access Control: Python, PyOTP (TOTP)
Logging: syslog, JSON logs, or CloudWatch/ELK stack
Monitoring: Custom dashboard or SIEM integration
